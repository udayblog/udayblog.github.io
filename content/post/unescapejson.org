jq is a great utility when dealing with json content. Sometimes one end up with looking at json content escaped as string and will become too cumbersome to read/process contents
For example, if you are using structured logging in your applications, you would often end up in this situation.

jq comes to rescue in such situtations. An example command to deal with escaped json string is below
#+begin_src bash
jq -r '.message' input.json | jq
#+end_src
