			<p>I used to blog not so frequently at <a href="https://experience-themaster.blogspot.com/">https://experience-themaster.blogspot.com/</a> and that has stopped as I had little time to write about.
This time I am trying to revive the habit of writing and making it more frequent.
I am getting my hands dirty with emacs org mode which is what I am using to post this.
I am hoping that one day, I might combine both blogs at one single place. More interesting content to follow.</p>
