      <description>I used to blog not so frequently at https://experience-themaster.blogspot.com/ and that has stopped as I had little time to write about. This time I am trying to revive the habit of writing and making it more frequent. I am getting my hands dirty with emacs org mode which is what I am using to post this. I hoping that one day, I might combine both blogs at one single place. More interesting content to follow.</description>
