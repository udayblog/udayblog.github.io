      <description>Before I start writing this post, I have a confession to make. I never thought I would be writing a post about an editor and itâ€™s configuration, yet here I am writing about one of the most renowned editors, neovim. There are numerous posts about neovim and its configuration out there, but there is always scope for one more blog post.
 The goal of this post is to setup neovim for go development quickly; I won&amp;#39;t go into detailing about each plugin and custom mappings.</description>

      <description>I used to blog not so frequently at https://experience-themaster.blogspot.com/ and that has stopped as I had little time to write about. This time I am trying to revive the habit of writing and making it more frequent. I am getting my hands dirty with emacs org mode which is what I am using to post this. I am hoping that one day, I might combine both blogs at one single place.</description>
